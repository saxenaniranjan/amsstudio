# ITIL Ticket Analytics Platform

A complete analytics platform for ITIL ticket dumps (Excel/CSV) with:
- robust preprocessing for messy exports,
- derived analyst-grade columns (Category, Business Function, MTTR, SLA Risk, Team Performance),
- natural-language query interface for insights and charts,
- unified graphing through **Plotly** (single chart library),
- automated test suite.

## What It Does

1. Ingests ticket dumps from common ITIL tools.
2. Normalizes columns and auto-maps aliases (`Incident ID`, `Assignment Group`, etc.).
3. Derives missing business columns:
   - `category_derived`
   - `business_function_derived`
   - `mttr_hours`
   - `ticket_age_hours`
   - `resolution_bucket`
   - `sla_threshold_hours`
   - `is_sla_breached`
   - `sla_risk`
   - `team_performance_index`
   - `team_performance_band`
4. Produces analyst-style outputs:
   - KPI summary,
   - anomaly detection in daily ticket volume,
   - actionable recommendations.
5. Supports free-form queries like:
   - "show bar chart of ticket count by team"
   - "top 5 categories by breach rate"
   - "recommend actions to reduce MTTR"
